# 0x09. C - Static libraries

# Requirements
# C

> 1. Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
> 2. All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
> 3. All your files should end with a new line
> 4. A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
> 5. Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
> 6. You are not allowed to use global variables
> 7. No more than 5 functions per file
> 8. You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden
> 9. You are allowed to use _putchar
> 10. You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
> 11. In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
> 12. The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
> 13. Don’t forget to push your header file

# Tasks

0. Create the static library libmy.a containing all the functions listed below:
> GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
> Directory: 0x09-static_libraries
> File: libmy.a, main.h

1. Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
> GitHub repository: alx-low_level_programming
> Directory: 0x09-static_libraries
> File: create_static_lib.sh
=======
## This project is the first C project as part of the ALX SE curriculum, and covers the very basics of compilation and C.

> 1. File 0-preprocessor is a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file.
> 2. File 1-compiler is a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
> 3. File 2-assembler is a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
> 4. File 3-name is a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
> 5. File 4-puts.c is a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
> 6. File 5-printf.c is a C program that prints exactly "with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,", followed by a new line.
> 7. File 6-size.c is a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
> 8. File 100-intel is a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
> 9. File 101-quote.c is a C program that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19", followed by a new line, to the standard error.
